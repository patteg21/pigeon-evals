## What is Pigeon Evals?

Pigeon Evals is a **modular RAG evaluation framework** designed for comprehensive **document processing**, **retrieval system benchmarking**, and **LLM evaluation**. It provides end-to-end functionality from document ingestion to performance evaluation, with support for multiple storage backends, embedding providers, and evaluation methodologies.

# RAG Evaluation Pipeline (`/evals/`)

## Overview
A modular pipeline for processing documents with embeddings, storage, and comprehensive evaluation. The pipeline transforms raw documents into searchable vector representations using configurable processors and storage backends. The primary driver behind this setup is to create a proper RAG evaluation pipeline that can also operate in a production setting.

## Usage
```bash
python src/main.py --config evals/configs/test.yml
# or
uv run src/main.py --config evals/configs/test.yml
```

## Pipeline Architecture
The pipeline follows a sequential processing flow:

1. **Document Loading** - Reads raw documents from specified directory
2. **Text Processing** - Applies configurable processors (tables, page breaks, TOC parsing)
3. **Embedding Generation** - Creates vector representations using OpenAI embeddings
4. **Dimensionality Reduction** - Supports PCA for reducing embedding dimensions (configurable output dimensions). Ideally would add in alternatives for the future such as [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as well as several other methods.
5. **Storage** - Saves processed data to both text (SQLite) and vector (Pinecone) stores
6. **Report Generation** - Can run Human Eval, LLM Eval, and MCP Agent Eval pipelines dynamically based on runs or seperate from runs entirely. Currently works for my local mcp too!

### Key Features
- **Fully modular design** - Add/remove/swap any processing component
- **Pydantic validation** - Type-safe configuration with automatic error detection
- **Multi-threaded embedding** - Parallel processing for faster execution
- **Flexible storage** - Support for multiple text and vector storage backends
- **Flexible Framework** - Removing any piece of this does not break the system, it simply skips that part, meaning this can be a full end to end eval pipeline

          args:

```

__TODO:__
- More ways to chunk the document, particularly around some of the markers within the document such as smaller sectional differences, bullet pointed lists, and paragraph level. Also adding in more versatility with overlapping, max_chunk_size etc 
- Include more Pydantic models and elmiate mores usages of dictionaries where reasonable for more structured and readble code practices. 
- Move the final parts of utils into more seperated pieces, primarily the typing which should be moved into the evals (since I am using shared typing I have not done so)
- Expirement with other types of search other than dense-embedding based, using sparse embeddings like TF-IDF or a mixture of both
- Finish the TOC Parser with the new updated code processing system (legacy code from first processing pipeline)
- If I had more access to the VectorDB I would also test some of the different sizing of Dimensions for Vectors

# MCP Server

FEATURES: 
- STDIO-compatible logging system
- Custom Error Exception Management System 


I opted to use the [Official MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) due to having used their Rust and TS servers in the past. The MCP can be implemented in both HTTP and STDIO. It is important to note that the project uses a custom logger instead of print statements due to the STDIO implementation.

To Run:
```bash
python main.py 
# or
uv run main.py
```

Tools
```bash
Search
    - vector_search
        Params: 
            query (str)
            ticker (Optional[str])
            entity_type (Optional[EntityType])
            year (Optional[str])

    - search_by_id
        Params:
            vector_id (str)

Visuals
    - create_table_visualization
        Params:
            headers (List[str])
